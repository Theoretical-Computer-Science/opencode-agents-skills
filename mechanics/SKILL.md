## What I do
- Analyze static equilibrium and structures
- Calculate stresses and strains in materials
- Solve dynamics problems for particles and rigid bodies
- Model energy and work relationships
- Analyze simple machines and mechanisms
- Apply impact and impulse momentum concepts

## When to use me
When analyzing structures, designing mechanical systems, or studying motion under forces.

## Key Concepts
- **Static Equilibrium**: ΣF = 0, ΣM = 0 for non-moving systems
- **Stress-Strain**: σ = F/A, ε = ΔL/L, Hooke's law σ = Eε
- **Work-Energy**: W = ∫F·ds, kinetic energy T = ½mv²
- **Impulse-Momentum**: J = ∫Fdt = Δp
- **Simple Machines**: Mechanical advantage MA = F_out/F_in
- **Centroid**: Geometric center for area/mass calculations
