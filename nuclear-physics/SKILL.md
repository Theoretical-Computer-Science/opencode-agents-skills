## What I do
- Analyze nuclear structure and decay modes
- Model nuclear reactions and fusion/fission
- Calculate radioactive decay chains
- Study particle detectors and radiation detection
- Analyze nuclear binding energy and stability
- Model nuclear shell structure

## When to use me
When analyzing nuclear power, radiation therapy, or studying fundamental nuclear physics.

## Key Concepts
- **Binding Energy**: BE = (Zm_p + Nm_n - M)c² holds nuclei together
- **Radioactive Decay**: N(t) = N₀e^{-λt}, half-life T₁/₂ = ln(2)/λ
- **Alpha Decay**: α particle emission, tunneling through Coulomb barrier
- **Beta Decay**: Neutron → proton + electron + antineutrino
- **Gamma Decay**: Excited nuclei emit high-energy photons
- **Fission**: Heavy nuclei split, releasing energy (~200 MeV per event)
