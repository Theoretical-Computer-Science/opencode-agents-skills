## What I do
- Apply the four laws of thermodynamics
- Calculate heat transfer and work processes
- Analyze thermodynamic cycles (Carnot, Rankine, refrigeration)
- Model heat engines and refrigerators
- Study phase equilibria and chemical potential
- Apply Maxwell relations and thermodynamic identities

## When to use me
When analyzing energy systems, designing heat engines, or studying thermal processes.

## Key Concepts
- **First Law**: ΔU = Q - W, energy conservation
- **Second Law**: ΔS ≥ 0, entropy never decreases in isolated systems
- **Carnot Efficiency**: η = 1 - T_c/T_h for heat engines
- **Clausius Inequality**: ∮δQ/T ≤ 0 for cyclic processes
- **Gibbs Free Energy**: G = H - TS determines spontaneity at constant T,P
- **Maxwell Relations**: (∂S/∂V)_T = (∂P/∂T)_V connect thermodynamic variables
