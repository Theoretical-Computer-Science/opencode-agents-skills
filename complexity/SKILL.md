## What I do
- Analyze time and space complexity of algorithms
- Classify problems by complexity classes (P, NP, PSPACE)
- Prove NP-completeness and NP-hardness
- Apply asymptotic notation (Big-O, Ω, Θ)
- Design approximation algorithms
- Analyze randomized algorithm complexity

## When to use me
When optimizing algorithms, proving computational limits, or classifying problem difficulty.

## Key Concepts
- **Big-O**: f = O(g) if ∃c,n₀: f(n) ≤ cg(n) for n ≥ n₀
- **P**: Problems solvable in polynomial time
- **NP**: Problems verifiable in polynomial time
- **NP-Complete**: Hardest problems in NP, polynomial-time reduction
- **Space Complexity**: Memory requirements vs input size
- **Polynomial-Time Reduction**: Transform one problem to another preserving complexity
