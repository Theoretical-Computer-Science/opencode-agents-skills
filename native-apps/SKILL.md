## What I do

- Build platform-specific mobile applications
- Develop with Swift/iOS, Kotlin/Android, or cross-platform native tools
- Access all native platform APIs and capabilities
- Optimize for platform-specific performance
- Follow platform design guidelines and conventions
- Implement native UI components
- Handle device-specific features

## When to use me

Use me when:
- Maximum app performance is required
- Deep integration with platform features needed
- Complex animations or graphics processing
-AR/VR applications
- Games and graphically intensive apps
- Apps requiring latest OS features
- Projects with platform-specific requirements

## Key Concepts

### Native vs Cross-Platform
| Aspect | Native | Cross-Platform |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Performance | Optimal | Good (overhead) |
| Platform APIs | Full access | Limited/wrapped |
| Development speed | Slower | Faster |
| Code sharing | None | High |
| UI consistency | Platform-native | Custom/framework |

### Native Development Paths

**iOS Native:**
- Language: Swift, Objective-C
- UI: SwiftUI, UIKit
- IDE: Xcode

**Android Native:**
- Language: Kotlin, Java
- UI: Jetpack Compose, XML
- IDE: Android Studio

### When to Choose Native
- Performance-critical applications
- Full hardware access required
- Long-term, flagship products
- Teams with platform expertise
- Complex platform integrations
