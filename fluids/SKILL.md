## What I do
- Analyze fluid statics and pressure distributions
- Calculate fluid forces on submerged surfaces
- Model capillary action and surface tension
- Study viscosity and non-Newtonian fluids
- Apply Bernoulli's principle to fluid systems
- Calculate pump and pipe flow requirements

## When to use me
When analyzing hydraulic systems, designing piping, or studying fluid behavior at rest.

## Key Concepts
- **Hydrostatic Pressure**: P = ρgh increases with depth
- **Archimedes' Principle**: Buoyant force = weight of displaced fluid
- **Surface Tension**: γ = energy/area, causes capillary rise h = 2γcosθ/(ρgr)
- **Pascal's Law**: Pressure applied to enclosed fluid transmits equally
- **Viscosity**: τ = μ(du/dy) for Newtonian fluids
- **Reynolds Number**: Re = ρvD/μ predicts flow regime
