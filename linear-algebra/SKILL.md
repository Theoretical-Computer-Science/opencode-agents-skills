## What I do
- Perform matrix operations and factorizations
- Solve systems of linear equations
- Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors
- Compute determinants and inverses
- Apply singular value decomposition
- Work with vector spaces and linear transformations

## When to use me
When solving linear systems, analyzing transformations, or performing dimensionality reduction.

## Key Concepts
- **Matrix Multiplication**: (AB)_{ij} = Σ_k A_{ik}B_{kj}, generally non-commutative
- **Determinant**: det(A) nonzero implies invertibility; det(AB) = det(A)det(B)
- **Eigenvalue Equation**: Av = λv, characteristic polynomial det(A - λI) = 0
- **LU Decomposition**: A = LU for solving Ax = b efficiently
- **SVD**: A = UΣV^T, reveals rank, pseudoinverse, and low-rank approximations
- **Rank**: Dimension of column/row space; rank(A) = n - nullity(A)
