## What I do
- Analyze nuclear structure and binding energy
- Model radioactive decay processes
- Calculate nuclear reaction rates
- Study fusion and fission energy
- Analyze radiation shielding requirements
- Model nuclear cross-sections

## When to use me
When working with nuclear energy, radiation detection, or medical physics applications.

## Key Concepts
- **Liquid Drop Model**: Semi-empirical mass formula for nuclear binding
- **Magic Numbers**: Closed shells give extra stability (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126)
- **Decay Chains**: Series of radioactive decays reaching stable lead/bismuth
- **Q-Value**: Energy release in nuclear reactions, Q = (m_initial - m_final)c²
- **Cross Section**: σ probability for nuclear interactions
- **Critical Mass**: Minimum mass for sustained nuclear fission
