## When to use me
When working with data-engineering in software development, system design, or technical problem-solving contexts.

## Core Concepts

### Fundamentals
Data Engineering involves understanding the core principles and theoretical foundations that underpin effective implementation.

### Implementation Approaches
- Direct implementation using standard libraries and frameworks
- Pattern-based design for scalability
- Optimization techniques for performance
- Error handling and edge cases
- Testing strategies

### Best Practices
- Follow industry standards and conventions
- Document APIs and interfaces
- Write maintainable and readable code
- Implement proper error handling
- Use appropriate testing methodologies

## Code Examples

```python
# Example: Basic Data Engineering implementation

class DataEngineering:
    '''
    Expert-level knowledge and advanced techniques
    '''
    
    def __init__(self, config: dict = None):
        self.config = config or {}
        self._initialize()
    
    def _initialize(self):
        '''Initialize the data-engineering system'''
        # Setup logic here
        pass
    
    def execute(self, input_data):
        '''
        Execute the main data-engineering operation.
        
        Args:
            input_data: Input to process
            
        Returns:
            Processed output
        '''
        # Core logic
        result = self._process(input_data)
        return result
    
    def _process(self, data):
        '''Internal processing logic'''
        # Implementation
        return data
```

```python
# Advanced usage example

def data_engineering_advanced(scenario: dict) -> dict:
    '''
    Handle complex data-engineering scenarios.
    
    Args:
        scenario: Complex input scenario
        
    Returns:
        Optimized result
    '''
    # Advanced implementation
    handler = DataEngineeringHandler()
    result = handler.handle(scenario)
    return result

class DataEngineeringHandler:
    '''Handle data-engineering operations'''
    
    def handle(self, scenario: dict) -> dict:
        '''Process scenario with data-engineering'''
        # Implementation
        return {
            "status": "processed",
            "data": scenario
        }
```

## Use Cases
- Building scalable applications using data-engineering
- Integrating data-engineering into existing systems
