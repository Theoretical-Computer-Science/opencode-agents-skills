## What I do
- Apply propositional and predicate logic
- Analyze mathematical proofs (induction, contradiction)
- Work with sets, relations, and functions
- Apply combinatorics and graph theory basics
- Solve recurrence relations
- Model with discrete structures

## When to use me
When studying computer science foundations, proving mathematical statements, or analyzing algorithms.

## Key Concepts
- **Logic**: Propositional operators ∧, ∨, ¬, →, ↔; quantifiers ∀, ∃
- **Proof by Induction**: Base case + inductive step proves for all n
- **Sets**: Union, intersection, complement, De Morgan's laws
- **Relations**: Reflexive, symmetric, transitive properties
- **Functions**: Injective, surjective, bijective classifications
- **Recurrence**: a_n defined in terms of previous terms
