# WebAssembly

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. It enables high-performance execution in web browsers and beyond, providing near-native execution speed for code written in C, C++, Rust, and other languages.

## Key Concepts

- Binary format for executable code
- Stack-based virtual machine
- Near-native performance in browsers
- Language-agnostic compilation target
- Sandboxed execution environment

## Common Use Cases

- High-performance web applications
- Video/image processing
- Games
- Scientific simulations
- Plugin systems

## Best Practices

- Minimize data transfer between JS and Wasm
- Use appropriate memory allocation strategies
- Consider linear memory model
- Profile performance critical paths
