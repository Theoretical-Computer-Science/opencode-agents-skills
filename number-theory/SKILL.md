## What I do
- Apply divisibility and prime factorization
- Solve Diophantine equations
- Work with modular arithmetic and congruences
- Apply Euler's theorem and Fermat's little theorem
- Analyze continued fractions
- Study cryptographic applications

## When to use me
When working with integer problems, cryptography, or coding theory.

## Key Concepts
- **Euclidean Algorithm**: gcd(a,b) = gcd(b, a mod b) for greatest common divisor
- **Prime Factorization**: Unique up to order (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic)
- **Modular Arithmetic**: a ≡ b (mod n) means n divides (a-b)
- **Euler's Totient**: φ(n) = count of integers ≤n coprime to n
- **Fermat's Little Theorem**: a^{p-1} ≡ 1 (mod p) for prime p, a not divisible by p
- **Chinese Remainder Theorem**: System of congruences has unique solution mod product
