## What I do
- Apply propositional and predicate calculus
- Construct mathematical proofs
- Analyze logical equivalence and validity
- Work with formal proof systems
- Apply Boolean algebra and logic circuits
- Study model theory and computability

## When to use me
When proving theorems, designing logic circuits, or studying formal systems.

## Key Concepts
- **Propositional Logic**: Variables p,q,r with operators ∧,∨,¬,→,↔
- **Predicate Logic**: Quantifiers ∀,∃ with predicates
- **Truth Tables**: Evaluate compound propositions
- **Modus Ponens**: From p and p→q, infer q
- **Proof by Contradiction**: Assume ¬P, derive contradiction, conclude P
- **Boolean Algebra**: Identities like De Morgan's laws ¬(p∧q) = ¬p∨¬q
