## What I do
- Analyze crystal structures and symmetry
- Model electronic band theory
- Study superconductivity and superfluidity
- Calculate phonon dispersion relations
- Analyze magnetic properties and phase transitions
- Apply density functional theory concepts

## When to use me
When studying solid-state physics, materials science, or semiconductor devices.

## Key Concepts
- **Crystal Lattices**: Bravais lattices, Miller indices for planes
- **Bloch's Theorem**: ψ_{k}(r) = e^{ik·r} u_k(r) for periodic potentials
- **Band Theory**: Energy bands arise from periodic potentials, band gaps
- **Fermi Surface**: Boundary between occupied and empty states at T=0
- **Phonons**: Quantized lattice vibrations, acoustic and optical modes
- ** BCS Theory**: Superconductivity from electron pairing below T_c
