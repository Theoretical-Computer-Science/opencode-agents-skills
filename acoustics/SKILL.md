## What I do
- Analyze sound wave propagation in gases, liquids, and solids
- Calculate acoustic impedance and reflection coefficients
- Design acoustic resonators and waveguides
- Model noise pollution and sound insulation
- Simulate musical instrument acoustics
- Compute Doppler effects and shock waves

## When to use me
When designing concert halls, acoustic metamaterials, sonar systems, noise barriers, or when analyzing sound behavior in different media.

## Key Concepts
- **Wave Equation**: ∂²p/∂t² = c²∇²p describes sound pressure evolution
- **Acoustic Impedance**: Z = ρc characterizes medium resistance to sound
- **Sound Intensity**: I = p²/(2ρc) for plane waves
- **Resonance**: f_n = nv/(2L) for standing waves in tubes
- **Doppler Effect**: f' = f(v ± v_o)/(v ∓ v_s)
