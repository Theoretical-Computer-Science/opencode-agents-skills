# TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open-source machine learning platform developed by Google. It provides comprehensive tools for building and deploying ML models, with strong production support.

## Key Concepts

- Computational graphs
- Keras high-level API
- tf.data for pipelines
- SavedModel format
- TensorFlow Serving

## Common Use Cases

- Production ML systems
- Large-scale distributed training
- Mobile/Edge deployment (TFLite)
- Computer vision
- NLP with Transformers

## Best Practices

- Use Keras for rapid prototyping
- Implement data pipelines with tf.data
- Use TensorBoard for monitoring
- Profile with tf.profiler
- Use TFX for MLOps
