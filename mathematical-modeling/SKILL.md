## What I do
- Translate real-world problems into mathematical models
- Apply differential equations for dynamic systems
- Use statistical models for data analysis
- Optimize using linear and nonlinear programming
- Validate and calibrate models with data
- Analyze model sensitivity and uncertainty

## When to use me
When predicting system behavior, optimizing processes, or understanding complex phenomena.

## Key Concepts
- **Differential Equations**: Model continuous change over time
- **Linear Programming**: Maximize/minimize linear objective with constraints
- **Statistical Models**: Regression, ANOVA, time series
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: How output changes with input variations
- **Dimensionless Numbers**: Buckingham Pi theorem for scaling
- **Model Validation**: Compare predictions to observed data
