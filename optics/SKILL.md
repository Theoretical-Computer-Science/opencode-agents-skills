## What I do
- Analyze geometric optics and lens systems
- Model wave optics and interference patterns
- Calculate diffraction and grating spectra
- Design optical instruments (telescopes, microscopes)
- Study polarization and birefringence
- Analyze laser cavities and coherence

## When to use me
When designing optical instruments, analyzing light behavior, or studying photonic devices.

## Key Concepts
- **Snell's Law**: n₁sinθ₁ = n₂sinθ₂ for refraction at interfaces
- **Thin Lens Equation**: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di for image formation
- **Interference**: Path difference Δ = mλ for constructive/destructive
- **Diffraction**: sinθ = mλ/a for single slit, d sinθ = mλ for grating
- **Malus's Law**: I = I₀cos²θ for polarized light through analyzer
- **Rayleigh Criterion**: θ = 1.22λ/D for angular resolution
