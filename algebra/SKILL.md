## What I do
- Solve equations and polynomial roots
- Factor expressions and find greatest common divisors
- Work with matrices and linear transformations
- Apply group, ring, and field theory
- Analyze vector spaces and basis transformations
- Solve systems of linear equations

## When to use me
When solving mathematical problems, working with abstract algebraic structures, or optimizing linear systems.

## Key Concepts
- **Quadratic Formula**: x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac))/2a for ax² + bx + c = 0
- **Matrix Multiplication**: (AB)_{ij} = Σ_k A_{ik}B_{kj}
- **Determinant**: det(A) nonzero implies matrix invertible
- **Eigenvalues**: Solutions to det(A - λI) = 0
- **Group**: Set with associative binary operation, identity, inverses
- **Field**: Commutative ring where nonzero elements form group
