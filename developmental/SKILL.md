## What I do

- Explain fundamental developmental processes
- Describe cell differentiation and fate
- Discuss pattern formation mechanisms
- Analyze growth regulation
- Explain metamorphosis and aging
- Connect genetics to development

## When to use me

- When learning about developmental biology basics
- When explaining how organisms develop
- When studying growth and differentiation
- When connecting genes to phenotype
- When preparing educational content

## Key Concepts

### Core Developmental Processes

1. **Cell Division**: Mitosis, asymmetric division
2. **Cell Differentiation**: Specialization into cell types
3. **Cell Migration**: Movement during morphogenesis
4. **Apoptosis**: Programmed cell death
5. **Growth**: Cell expansion and division

### Signaling in Development

- Autocrine: Cell to itself
- Paracrine: To neighboring cells
- Juxtacrine: Contact-dependent
- Endocrine: Via bloodstream

### Types of Development

**Direct Development**
- No larval stage
- Direct to adult form

**Indirect Development**
- Egg → Larva → Pupa → Adult
- Complete metamorphosis
- Incomplete metamorphosis

### Stem Cells

- Pluripotent: Any cell type (embryonic)
- Multipotent: Related cell types (adult)
- Unipotent: Single cell type
