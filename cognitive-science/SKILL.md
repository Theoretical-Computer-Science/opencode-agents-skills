## What I do

- Apply cognitive science to AI design
- Understand human cognition for better UX
- Design human-centered AI systems
- Model cognitive processes
- Create intuitive interfaces

## When to use me

Use me when:
- Building human-centered AI
- Designing intuitive interfaces
- Understanding user mental models
- Improving AI interpretability

## Key Concepts

### Cognitive Principles for AI
- **Mental Models**: Users have internal representations
- **Attention**: Limited capacity, needs prioritization
- **Memory**: Working memory constraints, chunking
- **Decision Making**: Bounded rationality

### Cognitive Load in UI
```python
# Principles to reduce cognitive load
design_principles = {
    "progressive_disclosure": "Show complexity gradually",
    "chunking": "Group related items (7±2)",
    "visual_hierarchy": "Guide attention",
    "consistency": "Reduce learning",
    "feedback": "Confirm actions",
    "recognition_vs_recall": "Minimize memory load"
}
```

### User Mental Models
- Match system to user's conceptual model
- Use familiar metaphors
- Provide clear affordances
- Enable undo and recovery
- Manage expectations

### Applying Cognitive Science
- **Information Processing**: Input → Processing → Output
- **Dual Process Theory**: System 1 (fast, intuitive) + System 2 (slow, deliberate)
- **Gestalt Principles**: Proximity, similarity, continuity
- **Fitts's Law**: Time to reach target depends on distance/size
