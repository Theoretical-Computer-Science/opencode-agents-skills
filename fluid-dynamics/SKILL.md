## What I do
- Analyze laminar and turbulent flow
- Solve Navier-Stokes equations
- Calculate boundary layer behavior
- Model compressible and incompressible flows
- Study multiphase fluid dynamics
- Analyze aerodynamic forces

## When to use me
When designing aircraft, ships, pipelines, or any system involving fluid flow.

## Key Concepts
- **Navier-Stokes**: ρ(∂v/∂t + v·∇v) = -∇p + μ∇²v + ρg
- **Reynolds Number**: Re = ρVL/μ characterizes laminar vs turbulent flow
- **Bernoulli's Equation**: P + ½ρv² + ρgh = constant along streamlines
- **Continuity Equation**: ∇·v = 0 for incompressible flow
- **Boundary Layer**: Thin region near surfaces where viscosity matters
- **Drag Force**: F_D = ½ρv²C_D A for bodies in flow
