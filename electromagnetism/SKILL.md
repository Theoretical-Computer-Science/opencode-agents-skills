## What I do
- Analyze electrostatic and magnetostatic fields
- Solve Maxwell's equations in various geometries
- Calculate electromagnetic wave propagation
- Model electromagnetic radiation and antennas
- Analyze reflection, refraction, and diffraction
- Study electromagnetic materials and waveguides

## When to use me
When designing electromagnetic devices, analyzing wave propagation, or studying optical systems.

## Key Concepts
- **Maxwell's Equations**: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀, ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, ∇·B = 0, ∇×B = μ₀J + μ₀ε₀∂E/∂t
- **Gauss's Law**: Electric flux through surface = enclosed charge/ε₀
- **Ampère's Law**: Magnetic field around current-carrying wire
- **Faraday's Law**: Changing magnetic flux induces EMF
- **Poynting Vector**: S = E × H for electromagnetic power flow
- **Wave Equation**: ∇²E - μ₀ε₀∂²E/∂t² = 0 in vacuum
