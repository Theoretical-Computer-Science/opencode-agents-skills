## What I do
- Analyze topological spaces and continuity
- Work with open and closed sets
- Study compactness and connectedness
- Apply homotopy and homology groups
- Analyze metric spaces
- Study fixed point theorems

## When to use me
When analyzing spatial properties that are preserved under continuous deformations.

## Key Concepts
- **Topological Space**: Set with collection of open sets satisfying union/finite intersection closure
- **Continuous Function**: f^{-1}(open) is open; preserves topological properties
- **Homeomorphism**: Bijective continuous map with continuous inverse
- **Compactness**: Every open cover has finite subcover; Heine-Borel in ℝⁿ
- **Connectedness**: Cannot be partitioned into two nonempty open sets
- **Homotopy**: Continuous deformation between maps; homotopy equivalence
