- When working with cell culture systems

## Key Concepts

### Cell Structure

**Major Organelles**
- Nucleus: DNA storage, transcription, replication
- Mitochondria: Energy production (ATP)
- Endoplasmic Reticulum: Protein folding (RER), lipid synthesis (SER)
- Golgi Apparatus: Protein modification and sorting
- Lysosomes: Cellular digestion
- Chloroplasts: Photosynthesis (plant cells)

### Cell Cycle Regulation

```python
# Example: Cell cycle phases
cell_cycle_phases = {
    'G1': 'Cell growth and preparation',
    'S': 'DNA replication',
    'G2': 'Growth and preparation for mitosis',
    'M': 'Mitotic division (prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase)'
}

# Key regulators
cyclins = ['Cyclin D', 'Cyclin E', 'Cyclin A', 'Cyclin B']
cdks = ['CDK4/6', 'CDK2', 'CDK2', 'CDK1']
```

### Signaling Pathways

- Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)
- G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)
- Intracellular receptors (steroid hormones)
- Second messengers (cAMP, Ca²⁺, IP₃)
- MAPK/ERK pathway
- PI3K/Akt pathway
- JAK-STAT signaling
