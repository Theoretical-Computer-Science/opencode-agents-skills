## Key Concepts

### Environmental Systems

**Atmosphere**
- Composition: N₂ (78%), O₂ (21%), Ar (0.9%)
- Layers: Troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere
- Greenhouse effect
- Ozone layer

**Hydrosphere**
- Water distribution: 97% oceans, 3% freshwater
- Water cycle: Evaporation, precipitation, runoff
- Ocean chemistry: Salinity, pH, currents

**Lithosphere**
- Rock cycle
- Soil formation
- Mineral resources

### Environmental Issues

- Climate change
- Air pollution
- Water pollution
- Deforestation
- Biodiversity loss
- Waste management

### Sustainability Principles

```python
# Example: Carbon footprint calculation
def carbon_footprint(energy_use, emission_factor):
    """
    Calculate CO2 emissions.
    energy_use: kWh or liters
    emission_factor: kg CO2 per unit
    """
    return energy_use * emission_factor

# Common emission factors
emission_factors = {
    'electricity': 0.5,  # kg CO2/kWh
    'gasoline': 2.3,    # kg CO2/liter
    'diesel': 2.7       # kg CO2/liter
}
```
