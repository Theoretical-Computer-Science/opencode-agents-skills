# Vector Databases

Vector databases store and query high-dimensional vector embeddings. They're essential for similarity search, semantic search, and AI-powered applications requiring vector operations.

## Key Concepts

- Embedding storage
- Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)
- Index types (HNSW, IVF, PQ)
- Similarity metrics (cosine, dot product, euclidean)
- Hybrid search capabilities

## Common Use Cases

- Semantic search
- RAG applications
- Recommendation systems
- Duplicate detection
- AI-powered chatbots

## Best Practices

- Choose index based on query patterns
- Monitor recall vs latency trade-offs
- Implement proper filtering
- Consider hybrid search
- Plan for scale early
