## What I do
- Apply Newton's laws to particle and rigid body motion
- Solve problems using Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics
- Analyze central force motion and orbital dynamics
- Calculate small oscillations and normal modes
- Study chaotic systems and sensitivity to initial conditions
- Model collisions and conservation of momentum/energy

## When to use me
When analyzing mechanical systems, designing machinery, or studying planetary/celestial motion.

## Key Concepts
- **Newton's Second Law**: F = ma relates force to acceleration
- **Lagrangian**: L = T - V, action S = ∫L dt, principle of least action
- **Hamiltonian**: H = T + V, canonical equations ∂q_i/∂t = ∂H/∂p_i
- **Conservation Laws**: Energy, momentum, angular momentum from symmetries
- **Central Forces**: Effective potential enables reduction to 1D problem
- **Rigid Body**: Angular momentum L = I·ω, Euler's equations
